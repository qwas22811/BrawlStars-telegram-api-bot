How to run this?

I will tell you how to run the bot locally on your computer without uploading it to the host. I will do this in the program VisualStudio Code.
⛔Important! you must already have python downloaded 

•First, you need to create a telegram bot and get its token.
(You can get it here: https://t.me/BotFather)


•Next you need a Brawl Stars token.
Together where they ask to enter an IP address just write your address. (You can get it here https://developer.brawlstars.com)


Then, you simply insert these tokens into the code (it will indicate where to paste them). you will also need to install a couple of python libraries. you just open the terminal and type the following commands one by one:

• pip install python-telegram-bot==20.3

• pip install requests

That's it now you can run the code. While your code is running the telegram bot will work. That's all for now!
